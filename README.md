#2D Scan Matching GUI

This is a program written in C# / .NET which performs scan-alignment to align a sequence of scans obtained from a laser range finder.Scan-alignment is a common framework for correct the pose of a mobile robot in an optimisation framework, it is also often used in generating proposal distributions for sequential monte-carlo (SMC) based simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) solutions. 

The scan alignment technique implemented here is similar to (TODO: insert reference). A similar technique is also implemented in https://github.com/nicodell88/Bragg-Edge-Fitting for obtaining the unknown pose-offsets of a poly-crystaline sample within an energy resolved neutron beam.
